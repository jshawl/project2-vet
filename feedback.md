# Feedback

## Project Workflow

**Meets Expectations**

Excellent comments in the Readme and user stories on Trello! In the future, please include
set up instructions for your application. This will be useful to future you and potential technical
employers / interviewers who are not familiar with rails.

## Technical Requirements

**Meets Expectations**

Great job implementing the many-to-many relationship with appointments! Would really like
to see you complete the CRUD (update and delete) functionality for appointments, and have
left code comments addressing relevant documentation.

## Creativity / Interface

**Meets Expectations**

Nice to see you implemented bootstrap well. Focus on user experience items in the future 
like the datetime dropdown and full crud functionality for appointments.

## Code Quality

## Deployment and Functionality

**Meets Expectations**

I was able to log in and CRUD appointments and Vets without any errors. Nice job! In the future, consider
restricting who can edit / delete based on who created the appointment or try implementing roles or authorization
with a gem like CanCanCan.
